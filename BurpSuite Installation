# BurpKit

## Introduction
Welcome to the next generation of web application penetration testing - using WebKit to own the web.
BurpKit is a BurpSuite plugin which helps in assessing complex web apps that render the contents of
their pages dynamically. It also provides a bi-directional JavaScript bridge API which allows users
to create quick one-off BurpSuite plugin prototypes which can interact directly with the DOM and
Burp's extender API.
